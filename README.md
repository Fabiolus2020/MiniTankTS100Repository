# MiniTankTS100Repository

This repository is for the mini tank project

sketch 1,2,3,4 connections are all the same.

sketch version 1 is to control tank with PWM with joystick.
sketch version 2 is to control tank with PWM differently from version 1 using joystick
sketch version 3 is to control tank using joystick for direction and potentiometer for speed using PWM.
sketch version 4 is to control tank using joytick for direction and potentiometer 1 for left motor and potentimeter 2 for right motor speed. This compensate for not having motors with encoders.


Sketch special edition is bassically all sketches together, I wanted to build the tank and not have to open each time therefore I included a push button on the remote so I can toggle between 3 different mode.
